# TEACH Platform - AI Integration Architecture

## 🎯 Vision
Transform TEACH from a learning platform into an **AI-powered teaching workspace** where everything happens seamlessly within one interface.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture Changes

### 1. **Unified AI Workspace**
Instead of teaching about individual AI tools, we provide them all integrated:

```
TEACH Platform
├── 📝 Lesson Builder (Powered by Claude)
├── 🎥 Media Studio (DALL-E, Synthesia, ElevenLabs)
├── 📊 Assessment Creator (Claude + Custom Logic)
├── 🤖 Automation Hub (Lindy, Zapier)
└── 📈 Analytics Dashboard (Auto-tracking everything)
```

### 2. **AI Provider Strategy**
- **Primary Providers**: Always prefer Anthropic Claude for text/lesson planning
- **Fallback System**: Each capability has 2 providers (primary + backup)
- **Transparency**: Show which AI generated each piece of content
- **Smart Routing**: Automatically switch providers on failure/limits

### 3. **Auto-Tracking System**
- No manual project submission needed
- Every AI interaction is tracked automatically
- Time saved calculations
- Content created metrics
- Usage patterns analysis

### 4. **Token Management**
```javascript
Quota Limits by Plan:
- FREE: 50K tokens/month (~25 lessons)
- INDIVIDUAL: 500K tokens/month (~250 lessons)
- SCHOOL: 2M tokens/month (~1000 lessons)
- GOVERNMENT: 10M tokens/month (~5000 lessons)
```

### 5. **Clear Error Handling**
- API failures show clear warnings
- Quota limits display remaining usage
- Fallback providers activate automatically
- Suggestions for better prompting
